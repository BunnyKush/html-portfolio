<h1>The Best Movies According to Doruk</h1> 
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I love everything about Medieval Times and also Fantasy</p>

<h3>The Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>As I said, I just love fantasy and when you mix that with magic, conjuring etc. It just gets better.</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Philosophy, is one of my passions. I remember when I watched this movie when I was a teenager, I just couldn't stop looking, reading about the things the movie wants to teach us about.</p>
